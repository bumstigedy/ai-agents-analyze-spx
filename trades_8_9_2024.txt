Target: $202.00 (below the 200-day SMA)

Rationale:
- Small caps more vulnerable to economic slowdown and tightening financial conditions
- Higher sensitivity to interest rates and banking sector stress
- More exposed to domestic economy, facing headwinds from inflation and Fed tightening

- RSI at 41.81, approaching oversold territory
- MACD positive but showing weakness

Risks:

- Approaching oversold levels, potential for short-term bounce

These trades aim to position for a more challenging economic environment while accounting for key market risks like recession fears, Fed policy uncertainty, and persistent inflation. The bullish consumer staples play offers defensive positioning, while the small cap short provides exposure to potential economic weakness. As always, proper risk management and position sizing are critical given the uncertain market backdrop.
