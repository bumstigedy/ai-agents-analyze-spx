Bullish Trade: NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)

Entry Point: $106.47 or on pullback to $100-$102
Stop Loss: $95
Target: $130
Rationale: NVIDIA is well-positioned to benefit from the ongoing AI boom and has strong fundamentals. The stock remains in a long-term uptrend despite recent pullback.
Risks:
- Short-term bearish momentum (MACD below signal line)
- General market volatility, especially in tech sector
- Potential overvaluation concerns in AI-related stocks

Bearish Trade: Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF)

Short Entry Point: $44.95 or on bounce to $45.50-$46.00
Stop Loss: $46.50
Target: $42.00
Rationale: Potential pause in Fed rate hikes could negatively impact financial stocks. XLF has been underperforming the broader market and shows signs of weakening momentum.
Risks:
- Current uptrend still intact (price above 50-day and 200-day SMAs)
- Potential for positive surprises in upcoming earnings season
- Broader market resilience could support financials

Key Considerations:
1. Both trades align with current market drivers and identified risks.
2. NVDA offers higher potential return (22% vs 6.5% for XLF) but with higher risk.
3. XLF short trade has a tighter stop loss (3.5% vs 10% for NVDA), reflecting lower volatility in the financial sector.
4. Monitor upcoming economic data, Fed statements, and Q2 earnings for potential impact on both trades.
5. Always use proper position sizing and risk management techniques.
6. Consider adjusting stops and targets based on changing market conditions and price action.
